released under the GNU General Public License. See the file COPYING.
A howto can be found at <http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net/Faq/Win32Gtk2>.

This nifty installer was created with a tool called "Inno Setup" which can be

Important remarks

- If you prefer to run the programs from the command line, it is better
  to add the "bin" directory of the installation in your PATH variable.

- The distribution includes libraries from the GtkWin (x86) or (x64) port
  originally written by Tor Lillqvist. More info can be found at
